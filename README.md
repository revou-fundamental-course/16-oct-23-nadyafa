Personal note:
I'm sorry if my project assignment seems really off. I thought "using your own design" in brief document qualification means I could design it however I want as long as it gives a hint of mockup original structure. Well, I guess I've completely misunderstood and got lost in it xixixi. I don't mind if, in the end, I'm not qualified for the certificate, but this has been an exciting two weeks for me doing this assignment with RevoU.
